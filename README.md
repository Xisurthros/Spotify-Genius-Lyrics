# Spotify API and Genius Lyrics API

> This project will get the song you are actively listening to on spotify.
> It will then send that information to the Genius API to get the lyrics for that song.

### Requirements

> You will have to login and create a Spotify App to use the API.\
> As well as create an API client for access to the Genuis API.\
> Both of which have links to the documentation on how to get these both set up.
